## Operational Analytics Portfolio

This repository presents selected real-world analytics projects developed to support operational and commercial decision-making across logistics and retail environments.

The focus of these dashboards is not visualization itself, but monitoring performance, detecting inefficiencies and enabling corrective actions through data.

All company identifiers and sensitive data have been anonymized.
